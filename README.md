# Predicting Student Outcomes

## Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis aimed at predicting student outcomes such as dropout, graduation, and current enrollment status. The project is designed to understand how various demographic, academic, and external factors influence student success in higher education. It features several machine learning models including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-NN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

## Dataset
The dataset employed in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's dataset on Student Performance. This dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). It comprises data from two Portuguese schools and includes 1,000 observations with 33 variables detailing student demographics, academic performance, and social factors.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this repository are to:
- Explore the underlying factors that contribute to student outcomes.
- Build predictive models to forecast student's academic trajectories such as dropouts, ongoing enrollments, or successful graduations.
- Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in handling educational data.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and scripts contained in this repository, the following Python libraries are required:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn

To install these libraries, use the following command:
